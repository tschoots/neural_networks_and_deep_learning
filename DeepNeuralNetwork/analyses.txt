layers_dims = [12288, 20, 7, 5, 1] # 5 layer model
initialization of W 
np.random.randn(layer_dims[l], layer_dims[l-1])/np.sqrt(layer_dims[l-1])

train
Accuracy: 0.985645933014
dev
Accuracy: 0.8

Initialization of W  with *0.01
train
Accuracy: 0.655502392344
dev
Accuracy: 0.34

Conclusion 
initialization with *0.01 high bias & high variance
